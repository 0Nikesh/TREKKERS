We also felt more comfortable sharing certain issues/details with \r\n        her and asking for advice. We received great care from her- she organized our accommodations,\r\n        meals, and itinerary, and even took good care of us when we became ill.\r\n        Our goal of reaching EBC was reached with good weather and beautiful views of the Himalayas.\r\n        </p>\r\n            <div className=\"d-flex align-items-center gap-4 mt-3\">\r\n                <img src={ava02} className='w-25 h-25 rounded-2' alt=\"\" />\r\n                <div>\r\n                    <h6 className='mb-0 mt-3'>Kim Jenny</h6>\r\n                    <p>Customer</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </Slider>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Fans"],"mappings":";AACA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,aAAa;AAChC,OAAOC,KAAK,MAAM,+BAA+B;AACjD,OAAOC,KAAK,MAAM,+BAA+B;AACjD,OAAOC,KAAK,MAAM,+BAA+B;AAAA,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAEjD,MAAMC,IAAI,GAAGA,CAAA,KAAM;EAEf,MAAMC,QAAQ,GAAC;IACXC,IAAI,EAAC,IAAI;IACTC,QAAQ,EAAC,IAAI;IACbC,QAAQ,EAAC,IAAI;IACbC,KAAK,EAAC,IAAI;IACVC,YAAY,EAAC,IAAI;IACjBC,aAAa,EAAC,IAAI;IAClBC,YAAY,EAAC,CAAC;IAEdC,UAAU,EAAC,CACP;MACIC,UAAU,EAAC,GAAG;MACdT,QAAQ,EAAE;QACNO,YAAY,EAAC,CAAC;QACdG,cAAc,EAAC,CAAC;QAChBR,QAAQ,EAAC,IAAI;QACbD,IAAI,EAAC;MACT;IACJ,CAAC,EAED;MACIQ,UAAU,EAAC,GAAG;MACdT,QAAQ,EAAE;QACNO,YAAY,EAAC,CAAC;QACdG,cAAc,EAAC;MACnB;IACJ,CAAC;EAGT,CAAC;EACH,oBACAZ,OAAA,CAACL,MAAM;IAAA,GAAKO,QAAQ;IAAAW,QAAA,gBAClBb,OAAA;MAAKc,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAmB;MAAAD,QAAA,gBAC9Bb,OAAA;QAAAa,QAAA,EAAG;MAQH;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACAlB,OAAA;QAAKc,SAAS,EAAC,sCAAsC;QAAAD,QAAA,gBACjDb,OAAA;UAAKmB,GAAG,EAAEvB,KAAM;UAACkB,SAAS,EAAC,qBAAqB;UAACM,GAAG,EAAC;QAAE;UAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eAC1DlB,OAAA;UAAAa,QAAA,gBACIb,OAAA;YAAIc,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAD,QAAA,EAAC;UAAS;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACxClB,OAAA;YAAAa,QAAA,EAAG;UAAQ;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACd,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACL,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACT,CAAC,eAENlB,OAAA;MAAKc,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAmB;MAAAD,QAAA,gBAC9Bb,OAAA;QAAAa,QAAA,EAAG;MAQH;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACAlB,OAAA;QAAKc,SAAS,EAAC,sCAAsC;QAAAD,QAAA,gBACjDb,OAAA;UAAKmB,GAAG,EAAEtB,KAAM;UAACiB,SAAS,EAAC,qBAAqB;UAACM,GAAG,EAAC;QAAE;UAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eAC1DlB,OAAA;UAAAa,QAAA,gBACIb,OAAA;YAAIc,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAD,QAAA,EAAC;UAAS;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACxClB,OAAA;YAAAa,QAAA,EAAG;UAAQ;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACd,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACL,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACT,CAAC,eAENlB,OAAA;MAAKc,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAmB;MAAAD,QAAA,gBAC9Bb,OAAA;QAAAa,QAAA,EAAG;MAUH;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACAlB,OAAA;QAAKc,SAAS,EAAC,sCAAsC;QAAAD,QAAA,gBACjDb,OAAA;UAAKmB,GAAG,EAAErB,KAAM;UAACgB,SAAS,EAAC,qBAAqB;UAACM,GAAG,EAAC;QAAE;UAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eAC1DlB,OAAA;UAAAa,QAAA,gBACIb,OAAA;YAAIc,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAD,QAAA,EAAC;UAAQ;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACvClB,OAAA;YAAAa,QAAA,EAAG;UAAQ;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACd,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACL,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACT,CAAC,eAENlB,OAAA;MAAKc,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAmB;MAAAD,QAAA,gBAC9Bb,OAAA;QAAAa,QAAA,EAAG;MAQH;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACAlB,OAAA;QAAKc,SAAS,EAAC,sCAAsC;QAAAD,QAAA,gBACjDb,OAAA;UAAKmB,GAAG,EAAEtB,KAAM;UAACiB,SAAS,EAAC,qBAAqB;UAACM,GAAG,EAAC;QAAE;UAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eAC1DlB,OAAA;UAAAa,QAAA,gBACIb,OAAA;YAAIc,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAD,QAAA,EAAC;UAAS;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACxClB,OAAA;YAAAa,QAAA,EAAG;UAAQ;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACd,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACL,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACT,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OAEA,CAAC;AAEX,CAAC;AAAAG,EAAA,GAlHKpB,IAAI;AAoHV,eAAeA,IAAI;AAAA,IAAAoB,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
